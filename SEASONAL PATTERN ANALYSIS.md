# Seasonal Pattern Analysis Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the methodology used for analyzing seasonal patterns in restaurant sales data, identifying peak weeks, and providing actionable business intelligence.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Validation**: Check for missing values, outliers, and data consistency
- **Date Handling**: Convert dates to proper format and extract temporal features
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify and handle extreme values using statistical methods
- **Variance Stabilization**: Apply transformations if needed (log, square root)

### 2. Seasonal Pattern Identification

#### Weekly Analysis
- **Week of Year**: Extract week numbers (1-52) from dates
- **Average Sales**: Calculate mean sales for each week across all years
- **Consistency**: Identify weeks that consistently show high performance
- **Trend Analysis**: Detect increasing or decreasing patterns

#### Monthly Analysis
- **Monthly Averages**: Calculate mean sales for each month
- **Seasonal Strength**: Quantify the strength of seasonal patterns (0-1 scale)
- **Peak Months**: Identify months with consistently high sales
- **Preparation Timeline**: Determine optimal preparation periods

#### Quarterly Analysis
- **Quarterly Patterns**: Analyze sales by business quarters
- **Seasonal Shifts**: Identify quarter-to-quarter changes
- **Business Planning**: Align with fiscal planning cycles

### 3. Peak Week Identification

#### Statistical Threshold
- **Mean + 1 Standard Deviation**: Primary threshold for peak identification
- **Consistency Check**: Weeks that appear as peaks in multiple years
- **Reliability Score**: Percentage of years a week appears as peak

#### Business Criteria
- **Preparation Time**: 3-week advance notice for business preparation
- **Resource Planning**: Inventory, staffing, and marketing considerations
- **Risk Assessment**: Variability in peak week performance

## Key Metrics

### Seasonal Strength Index
```
Seasonal Strength = Variance(Seasonal Component) / Total Variance
```
- **0.0-0.3**: Weak seasonality
- **0.3-0.6**: Moderate seasonality  
- **0.6-1.0**: Strong seasonality

### Peak Week Reliability
```
Reliability = (Years as Peak) / (Total Years) × 100
```
- **80-100%**: Highly reliable peak week
- **60-79%**: Moderately reliable peak week
- **40-59%**: Somewhat reliable peak week
- **<40%**: Unreliable peak week

### Business Impact Score
```
Impact Score = (Peak Sales - Average Sales) / Average Sales × 100
```
- **>20%**: High impact peak
- **10-20%**: Moderate impact peak
- **5-10%**: Low impact peak
