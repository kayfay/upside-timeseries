## üìà Analysis Methods

### 1. Advanced Time Series Decomposition
- **STL Decomposition**: Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess
- **Trend Component**: 85% contribution - Linear growth from $40K to $57K/week
- **Seasonal Component**: 15% contribution - Bimodal pattern with 6-month cycles
- **Residual Component**: <5% contribution - Low random fluctuations

### 2. Detrended Analysis
- **Growth Bias Removal**: Eliminates upward trend to reveal true seasonal patterns
- **True Seasonal Patterns**: Consistent peaks and troughs across years
- **Performance Evaluation**: Unbiased assessment based on seasonal effects

### 3. Pattern Recognition
- **Weekly Heatmaps**: Detrended sales intensity by week and year
- **Monthly Patterns**: Original vs detrended sales comparison
- **Peak/Trough Identification**: October/November and April/May peaks, January/February and July/August troughs

## üìä Key Business Insights

### Growth Analysis
- **Strong Growth Trend**: $17,000 increase over 2-year period (July 2023 - July 2025)
- **Weekly Growth**: $177.86 per week ($9,200+ annual growth)
- **Sustainable Trajectory**: Continued upward momentum into 2025

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Primary Peak**: October/November (+$8K-$10K above trend)
- **Secondary Peak**: April/May (+$6K-$8K above trend)
- **Primary Trough**: January/February (-$8K-$10K below trend)
